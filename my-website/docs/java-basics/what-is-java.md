# What is Java?

Java is a high-level, object-oriented, and platform-independent programming language. It was first developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle Corporation) in the mid-1990s. Java is known for its "write once, run anywhere" capability, which means that Java code can be written on one platform and executed on any platform with a compatible Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

## Key Components

The JDK, JRE, and JVM are key components of the Java programming platform. They play distinct roles in the execution and development of Java applications:

### **1. Java Development Kit (JDK):**

Purpose: The JDK is a software package that provides tools and libraries necessary for developing Java applications.

Components: It includes the Java compiler (javac), which is used to compile Java source code into bytecode, and a range of development tools such as the debugger (jdb), JavaDoc for generating documentation, and various libraries.

Usage: Developers use the JDK to write, compile, and build Java applications. It provides everything needed for development, including the Java Runtime Environment (JRE).

### **2. Java Runtime Environment (JRE):**

Purpose: The JRE is a runtime environment that allows Java applications to run on a computer. It provides the necessary runtime libraries and resources for executing Java applications.

Components: The JRE includes the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), the Java class libraries (Java API), and other runtime components needed to execute Java applications.

Usage: End users who want to run Java applications on their computers need the JRE installed. They don't need the JDK unless they are also developers.

### **3. Java Virtual Machine (JVM):**

Purpose: The JVM is an integral part of both the JDK and JRE. It is responsible for executing Java bytecode, which is the compiled form of Java source code.

Components: The JVM consists of three main components:

Class Loader: Loads class files (bytecode) into memory.
Execution Engine: Interprets and executes the bytecode.
Garbage Collector: Manages memory, automatically deallocating objects that are no longer needed.
Usage: The JVM is the runtime engine that executes Java applications. It ensures that Java code is platform-independent by running bytecode on the host operating system.
